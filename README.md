## Where to Find Impulse Responses

Impulse responses are essential for using this application. Here are some sources:

### Free IR Resources
- **[Redwirez](http://www.redwirez.com/)** - Free guitar cabinet IRs (requires registration)
- **[GuitarHack](http://www.guitarhack.com/)** - Free metal/rock cabinet impulses
- **[God's Cab](http://www.wilkinsonaudio.com/godscab/)** - Free Celestion G12M cabinet IRs
- **[OpenAir](https://www.openair.hosted.york.ac.uk/)** - Free room and reverb impulse responses
- **[Voxengo Impulses](https://www.voxengo.com/impulses/)** - Free reverb and acoustic impulse responses

### Commercial IR Packs
- **OwnHammer** - Professional guitar cabinet IRs
- **Celestion** - Official speaker cabinet IRs
- **ML Sound Lab** - High-quality cabinet simulations
- **Two Notes** - Wall of Sound IR collections

### Creating Your Own IRs
You can create custom impulse responses by:
1. Recording a space or equipment with a test signal (sine sweep or impulse)
2. Using deconvolution software to extract the IR
3. Popular tools: REW (Room EQ Wizard), Altiverb XL, Voxengo Deconvolver

## Technology Stack

- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for robust code
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **Web Audio API**: Browser-native audio processing
- **ConvolverNode**: For impulse response convolution
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with gradients and animations

### Key Components

- **AudioDSPProcessor**: Main class handling audio context, file loading, and processing
- **Web Audio Graph**: Dynamic routing with dry/wet paths and convolver node
- **Event Handlers**: File uploads, playback controls, and real-time parameter adjustments

## Audio Processing

The application uses the Web Audio API's ConvolverNode to perform real-time convolution between the audio sample and the impulse response. This simulates the acoustic characteristics of the space or equipment captured in the impulse response file.

### Signal Flow

```
Audio Sample ‚Üí [Dry Path] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí Dry Gain ‚Üí Master Gain ‚Üí Output
              ‚Üì
              [Wet Path] ‚Üí Convolver ‚Üí Wet Gain ‚Üó
```

### How It Works

1. **FFT Processing**: The ConvolverNode uses Fast Fourier Transform to convert both audio signals to frequency domain
2. **Convolution**: Multiplies the frequency representations together
3. **IFFT**: Converts back to time domain for playback
4. **Real-time Mixing**: Dry and wet signals are continuously blended based on the mix control

## Use Cases & Examples

### üé∏ Guitar Cabinet Simulation
Load a cabinet IR (Mesa Boogie, Marshall, etc.) to process a direct guitar signal (DI track). Perfect for:
- Home recording without mic'ing an amp
- Re-amping tracks with different cabinet tones
- Quick tone previews during songwriting

### üèõÔ∏è Adding Reverb
Use room or hall IRs to add realistic acoustic spaces:
- Vocal processing with natural reverb
- Simulating concert hall acoustics
- Creating ambient guitar textures

### üéöÔ∏è Professional Mixing
Preview tracks with different acoustic characteristics:
- A/B testing different cabinet IRs
- Finding the right reverb space
- Stem processing with consistent ambience

### üéì Learning & Education
Understand audio processing concepts:
- Hear the difference between dry and processed signals
- Experiment with convolution in real-time
- Compare different impulse responses

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge: ‚úÖ Full support
- Firefox: ‚úÖ Full support  
- Safari: ‚úÖ Full support
- Opera: ‚úÖ Full support

## Performance & Limitations

### Recommended Specifications
- **IR Length**: Best performance with IRs under 5 seconds
- **File Size**: Audio samples up to 50MB work smoothly
- **Sample Rate**: Any sample rate (browser handles resampling)
- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit or 24-bit audio files recommended

### Performance Tips
- Longer IRs (>10 seconds) may cause slight CPU spikes on mobile devices
- Stereo IRs provide better spatial accuracy but use more processing power
- Close other audio-intensive browser tabs for best performance
- On mobile, keep screen on during playback for optimal performance

### Browser-Specific Notes
- **Safari (iOS)**: May require user interaction to initialize audio context
- **Chrome**: Hardware acceleration enabled by default for best performance
- **Firefox**: Excellent stability with large IR files
- **Mobile Browsers**: Some latency may occur with very long IRs (>15 seconds)
